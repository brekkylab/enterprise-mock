"""Derive an MCP-ready OpenAPI spec from the mock's own ``/openapi.json``.

For vendor fidelity several routes accept **more than one HTTP method on a single route** — every
Slack Web API method takes GET and POST (``api_route(methods=["GET","POST"])``), Jira's
``search/jql`` likewise on both its ``/rest/api/2`` and ``/rest/api/3`` aliases, S3's object route
GET and HEAD. FastAPI derives one operationId *per route* and reuses it for each method, so the raw
``/openapi.json`` ends up with ~14 *duplicate* operationIds. An OpenAPI→MCP bridge keys its tools by
operationId, so a raw spec would collide (one tool silently overwriting the other).

This can't be fixed with FastAPI's operationId hooks (``operation_id=`` / ``generate_unique_id_function``):
those run *per route* and return a single id for all of a route's methods — there is no per-method
hook, so a GET+POST route is inherently one id. Splitting every such route into single-method routes
would be invasive and still leave a redundant GET-tool + POST-tool pair. Instead this module keeps
the fidelity-shaped routes as-is and, for MCP consumers, slices the spec to one source's paths and
collapses each route's methods to one callable operation (prefer GET, then fewest path params, then
the lexicographically greatest path). Served at ``GET /_mock/openapi/{source}`` so a bridge consumes
it directly — no client-side spec surgery. S3 is intentionally absent: it is SigV4-signed, which a
static bridge auth header can't produce.
