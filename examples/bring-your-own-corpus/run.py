"""Bring-Your-Own corpus, end to end: validate a JSONL, then serve it. Self-contained.

Validates the sample corpus against the schemas, starts a real mock server backed by it
(a uvicorn subprocess — nothing else needs to be running), prints what got served, and keeps
serving until you press Ctrl+C.
